BARTLEBY THE SCRIVENER: A MODERN RETELLING

I am an elderly lawyer. For the past thirty years, I have worked with law copyists, also known as scriveners. These are men who hand-copy legal documents for a living. I have known many of them over the years, but I want to tell you about one in particular. His name was Bartleby. He was the strangest person I ever encountered.

I cannot provide you with a complete biography of Bartleby. The materials simply do not exist. I can only tell you what I personally witnessed during our time together, along with one unverified rumor I heard later.

Before I introduce Bartleby, I should describe myself and my office. I am a man who believes that the easiest path in life is the best one. I am an unambitious lawyer who never addresses juries or seeks public attention. Instead, I work quietly with wealthy clients on bonds, mortgages, and property titles. Everyone considers me extremely safe and reliable. The late John Jacob Astor himself praised my prudence and methodology. I was not insensible to his good opinion.

Shortly before this story begins, I received an appointment to the now-defunct office of Master in Chancery in New York. This position was not demanding but paid well. I must say that I considered its abolition by the new Constitution to be premature, as I had expected to enjoy its profits for many more years.

My office was located upstairs on Wall Street. The windows on one end looked out onto a white wall inside a ventilation shaft. The view on the other end was equally uninspiring—a tall brick wall, blackened with age, stood just ten feet from my windows. Due to the height of surrounding buildings and my second-floor location, the space between the walls resembled a large cistern.

At the time Bartleby arrived, I employed two copyists and an office boy. The first copyist was Turkey, a short, heavy Englishman around sixty years old. In the morning, his face had a healthy color, but after noon—his dinner hour—it turned bright red like burning coals. This redness continued until six o'clock in the evening. Unfortunately, Turkey's work quality declined dramatically in the afternoons. He became energetic to the point of recklessness, making blots on documents, creating noise with his chair, and generally behaving inappropriately for a man his age.

I tried to suggest that Turkey work only mornings, but he insisted his afternoon services were indispensable. He compared himself to a military commander, saying he marshaled his forces in the morning but led the charge in the afternoon. When I mentioned the blots he made, he appealed to our shared age, suggesting that a few afternoon blots should not be held against gray hair. I could not resist this appeal, so I let him stay, deciding to give him only less important documents in the afternoons.

My second copyist was Nippers, a young man around twenty-five with whiskers and a somewhat piratical appearance. He suffered from two problems—ambition and indigestion. His ambition made him impatient with ordinary copying work. He wanted to draw up original legal documents instead. His indigestion caused nervous irritability and teeth grinding. He was constantly dissatisfied with his desk height, trying various adjustments with chips, blocks, and folded paper, but nothing worked.

Nippers also involved himself in ward politics and occasionally conducted business at the Justices' courts. Despite these issues, he was useful to me. He wrote quickly and neatly, and he dressed in a gentlemanly manner, which reflected well on my office.

Fortunately, Turkey and Nippers complemented each other. Nippers was irritable in the mornings but calm in the afternoons. Turkey was steady in the mornings but problematic after noon. This meant I only had to deal with one difficult employee at a time.

My third employee was Ginger Nut, a twelve-year-old boy. His father was a cart driver who wanted his son to become a lawyer instead. The boy worked as an errand runner, cleaner, and general assistant for one dollar per week. His primary duty was buying cakes and apples for Turkey and Nippers. He was named after a particular type of spicy ginger cake that the copyists frequently requested.

When my responsibilities as Master in Chancery increased my workload, I needed additional help. In response to my advertisement, a young man appeared at my office one summer morning. He stood motionless at the threshold. I can still see him—pale, neat, respectable, and profoundly forlorn. It was Bartleby.

After a brief discussion of his qualifications, I hired him. I thought his calm demeanor might have a positive influence on Turkey and Nippers. I placed his desk near the folding doors that separated my area from the copyists, but on my side. His desk was by a small window that offered no real view, just a wall three feet away. I installed a high green folding screen to give him privacy while keeping him within earshot.

At first, Bartleby worked with extraordinary intensity. He seemed to devour my documents, copying day and night without pause. I would have been pleased with this dedication if he had shown any cheerfulness. Instead, he worked silently, palely, and mechanically.

It is standard practice for scriveners to verify the accuracy of copied documents. Typically, one person reads from the original while another follows along with the copy. This is dull, tedious work. On the third day after Bartleby started, I needed to verify a small document quickly. I called him to assist me, expecting immediate compliance.

I sat with my head over the original document, my right hand extended with the copy, ready for Bartleby to take it. I stated what I wanted him to do—examine the paper with me. To my surprise, he replied in a mild but firm voice, "I would prefer not to."

I sat in silence, thinking I must have misheard him. I repeated the request more clearly. Again came the reply, "I would prefer not to."

I stood up in excitement and crossed the room. "What do you mean? Are you insane? I want you to help me compare this sheet." I thrust the paper toward him.

"I would prefer not to," he said.

I looked at him carefully. His face was calm, his gray eyes dim and composed. No sign of agitation showed anywhere. If he had displayed any normal human emotion—anger, impatience, or rudeness—I would have immediately dismissed him. But his complete stillness disarmed me. I stood watching him, then returned to my desk. I thought the situation very strange but decided to deal with it later. I called Nippers instead, and we examined the paper.

A few days later, Bartleby completed four lengthy documents that required careful verification. I called Turkey, Nippers, and Ginger Nut to help examine them. Each would hold a copy while I read from the original. When everyone was seated, I called for Bartleby to join us.

I heard his chair scrape slowly across the floor. He appeared at the entrance of his screened area.

"What is wanted?" he asked mildly.

"The copies," I said hurriedly. "We are going to examine them." I held the fourth copy toward him.

"I would prefer not to," he said, and gently disappeared behind the screen.

For a moment I stood frozen. When I recovered, I approached the screen and demanded an explanation.

"Why do you refuse?"

"I would prefer not to."

With anyone else, I would have erupted in anger and thrown him out immediately. But something about Bartleby disarmed me and even disturbed me. I began reasoning with him.

"These are your own copies we are examining. One examination will verify all four papers. This is common practice. Every copyist helps examine his work. Will you not answer?"

"I prefer not to," he replied in a flute-like tone. He seemed to have considered my argument carefully, understood it completely, but still chose to refuse.

"You are decided not to comply with a request made according to common practice and common sense?"

He gave me to understand that his decision was final.

Sometimes when a person is contradicted in an unreasonable way, he begins to doubt his own position. He wonders if perhaps the other person is right. I turned to my other employees for support.

"Turkey, what do you think? Am I not right?"

"With submission, sir, I think that you are," Turkey replied politely.

"Nippers, what do you think?"

"I think I should kick him out of the office," Nippers said.

The reader will note that it was morning, so Turkey answered politely while Nippers responded with irritation.

"Ginger Nut, what do you think?"

"I think he's a little crazy, sir," replied the boy with a grin.

"You hear what they say," I told Bartleby through the screen. "Come out and do your duty."

He gave no reply. I pondered the situation but decided again to postpone dealing with it. We examined the papers without Bartleby, though Turkey kept remarking that this was unusual, and Nippers muttered curses about the stubborn man behind the screen.

Meanwhile, Bartleby remained in his area, completely focused on his own work.

Over the following days, I observed Bartleby more carefully. I noticed he never went to dinner. In fact, he never seemed to leave the office at all. He was a permanent fixture in the corner. Around eleven o'clock each morning, Ginger Nut would approach Bartleby's screen, apparently summoned by some invisible gesture. The boy would leave with some coins and return with ginger cakes, which he delivered to Bartleby.

So he lives on ginger cakes, I thought. He never eats a proper dinner. He must be a vegetarian—but no, he does not even eat vegetables. He eats nothing but ginger cakes. I wondered about the effects of such a diet. Ginger is a hot, spicy ingredient. Was Bartleby hot and spicy? Not at all. Clearly, the ginger had no effect on him.

Nothing aggravates an earnest person more than passive resistance. When the resisting person is harmless in his passivity, one tries to understand what cannot be solved by judgment alone. I regarded Bartleby this way. Poor fellow, I thought, he means no harm. His eccentricities seem involuntary. He is useful to me. If I dismiss him, he will find a less tolerant employer and be treated badly. Perhaps he will starve. Here I can afford to be charitable at little cost to myself. This thought pleased my conscience.

But my mood was not always so generous. Sometimes Bartleby's passiveness irritated me. I felt driven to provoke some reaction from him. One afternoon I attempted this.

"Bartleby," I said, "when those papers are all copied, I will compare them with you."

"I would prefer not to."

"Surely you do not mean to persist in that stubborn refusal?"

No answer.

I opened the folding doors and turned to Turkey and Nippers. "He says he will not examine his papers. What do you think of it, Turkey?"

It was afternoon, remember. Turkey sat glowing red, his bald head steaming.

"Think of it?" Turkey roared. "I think I will step behind his screen and black his eyes!"

He rose and assumed a fighting position. He was rushing toward Bartleby when I stopped him, alarmed at having provoked Turkey's combativeness.

"Sit down, Turkey," I said. "What do you think, Nippers? Would I be justified in dismissing Bartleby immediately?"

"That is for you to decide, sir. His conduct is unusual and unjust to Turkey and myself. But it may only be a temporary whim."

"You have changed your opinion," I said. "You speak gently of him now."

"All beer," cried Turkey. "Gentleness is the effect of beer. Nippers and I dined together today. Shall I go and black his eyes?"

"No, not today, Turkey," I replied. "Put away your fists."

I closed the doors and approached Bartleby again. I felt tempted to provoke his refusal once more. I remembered that Bartleby never left the office.

"Bartleby," I said, "Ginger Nut is away. Step around to the Post Office and see if there is anything for me. It is only a three-minute walk."

"I would prefer not to."

"You will not?"

"I prefer not."

I staggered back to my desk. Was there anything else I could ask him to do that he would refuse? I called his name loudly three times. Like a ghost responding to a magical summons, he appeared at the entrance of his area.

"Go to the next room and tell Nippers to come to me."

"I prefer not to," he said respectfully and slowly, then mildly disappeared.

"Very good, Bartleby," I said in a quiet but severe tone. I half intended some terrible consequence for him. But as it was approaching my dinner hour, I decided to go home for the day, suffering from considerable perplexity.

I must admit what happened next. It soon became an established fact in my office that Bartleby had a desk there and copied at the usual rate of four cents per hundred words, but he was permanently exempt from examining documents. That duty was transferred to Turkey and Nippers. Moreover, Bartleby was never to be sent on errands of any kind. Everyone understood that he would simply refuse.

As days passed, I became reconciled to Bartleby. His steadiness, lack of dissipation, constant industry, stillness, and unchanging demeanor made him valuable. One key advantage was that he was always there—first in the morning, present throughout the day, and last at night. I had complete confidence in his honesty. Sometimes I would inadvertently summon Bartleby to do something, and when he responded with his usual "I prefer not to," I would become frustrated. How could anyone with normal human nature not react bitterly to such unreasonableness? However, each refusal made me less likely to repeat the mistake.

Most legal offices in the building had multiple keys to their doors. One key was kept by a cleaning woman who lived in the attic. Another was kept by Turkey for convenience. I sometimes carried a third. I did not know who had the fourth.

One Sunday morning, I decided to attend Trinity Church to hear a celebrated preacher. Arriving early, I thought I would stop by my office for a while. I had my key with me, but when I tried to insert it into the lock, I found it blocked from inside. Surprised, I called out. To my shock, a key turned from within, and Bartleby appeared, holding the door slightly open. He was in his shirt sleeves and looked disheveled. He said quietly that he was busy and preferred not to admit me at present. He suggested I walk around the block a few times, and by then he would probably be finished with his affairs.

The unexpected appearance of Bartleby in my office on a Sunday morning, with his calm yet firm manner, had such a strange effect that I simply walked away from my own door as he requested. But I felt rebellious against this mild audacity from my hired clerk. His wonderful mildness had unmanned me. I was filled with unease about what Bartleby could be doing in my office on a Sunday morning. Whatever it was, it surely was not copying.

After some time, I returned to the door. I entered without hindrance. Bartleby was gone. Upon closer examination, I realized that Bartleby must have been eating, dressing, and sleeping in my office for an indefinite period. I found a blanket rolled under his desk, a blacking box and brush under the empty fireplace, a basin with soap and a ragged towel on a chair, and a few ginger cake crumbs wrapped in newspaper.

The thought struck me—what miserable friendlessness and loneliness this revealed. His poverty was great, but his solitude was horrible. I thought about Wall Street on Sundays, as deserted as ancient ruins. The building that hummed with life on weekdays echoed with emptiness at night and all through Sunday. And here Bartleby made his home, the sole occupant of this solitude.

For the first time in my life, I felt overwhelming melancholy. I had never experienced anything beyond mild sadness before. A sense of common humanity drew me to gloom. I remembered the bright, cheerful people I had seen that day on Broadway and contrasted them with the pale copyist. Happiness courts the light, so we think the world is happy. But misery hides, so we think misery does not exist.

I was attracted to Bartleby's closed desk, with the key left in the lock. I reasoned that the desk was mine, as were its contents, so I could look inside. Everything was methodically arranged. In one of the pigeonholes, I found an old bandanna handkerchief, heavy and knotted. Opening it, I discovered it was a savings bank.

I recalled all the quiet mysteries I had noticed about Bartleby. He never spoke except to answer. He never read, not even a newspaper. For long periods he would stand looking at the dead brick wall outside his window. I was certain he never visited any restaurant or eating house. He never drank beer or even tea or coffee. He never went anywhere that I could learn. He never went out for walks. He declined to say who he was, where he came from, or whether he had any relatives. Though thin and pale, he never complained of illness. Above all, there was a certain austere reserve about him that had intimidated me into accepting his eccentricities.

Considering all this, along with the discovery that he lived in my office, a sense of prudence began to replace my initial melancholy. My first emotions had been pity, but as I fully grasped Bartleby's forlornness, that pity turned to fear and even repulsion. Up to a certain point, the sight of misery enlists our sympathy. But beyond that point, it does not. This is not due to human selfishness but rather to the hopelessness of remedying extreme suffering. To a sensitive person, pity becomes pain. When it is clear that pity cannot lead to effective help, common sense says to rid oneself of it. That morning I realized that Bartleby suffered from an incurable disorder. I might give money to support his body, but his body did not pain him. It was his soul that suffered, and I could not reach his soul.

I did not go to Trinity Church that morning. The things I had seen disqualified me for worship. I walked home, thinking about what I would do with Bartleby. I decided to ask him some calm questions the next morning about his history. If he declined to answer openly, I would give him a twenty-dollar bill beyond what I owed him and tell him his services were no longer required. If I could help him return to his native place, I would willingly pay the expenses. If he later needed aid, he could write to me.

The next morning came.

"Bartleby," I called gently.

No reply.

"Bartleby," I said more gently, "come here. I am not going to ask you to do anything you would prefer not to do. I simply wish to speak to you."

He slid into view.

"Will you tell me where you were born?"

"I would prefer not to."

"Will you tell me anything about yourself?"

"I would prefer not to."

"But what reasonable objection can you have? I feel friendly toward you."

He did not look at me while I spoke. His gaze was fixed on my bust of Cicero behind me.

"What is your answer, Bartleby?" I asked after waiting a considerable time. His face remained motionless, though I detected the faintest tremor of his pale mouth.

"At present I prefer to give no answer," he said, and retired.

I confess his manner on this occasion annoyed me. There seemed to be disdain in it, and his stubbornness seemed ungrateful considering how well I had treated him. I sat considering what to do. Despite being resolved to dismiss him when I entered the office, I felt something superstitious preventing me from carrying out my purpose, condemning me as a villain if I spoke one bitter word against this forlorn man.

Finally, I drew my chair behind his screen and sat down. "Bartleby, never mind about your history. But please comply with the office customs. Say that tomorrow or the next day you will help examine papers. Say that in a day or two you will begin to be a little reasonable."

"At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable," was his mildly cadaverous reply.

Just then the folding doors opened and Nippers approached. He had suffered from unusually bad indigestion that night. He had overheard Bartleby's final words.

"Prefer not?" Nippers muttered angrily. "I would prefer him if I were you, sir. I would give him preferences! What is it he prefers not to do now?"

Bartleby did not move.

"Mr. Nippers," I said, "I would prefer that you withdraw for the present."

I realized I had begun unconsciously using the word "prefer" on unsuitable occasions. I worried that contact with Bartleby had affected me mentally. What further problems might it cause? This concern helped determine me toward decisive action.

As Nippers departed looking sour and sulky, Turkey approached politely.

"With submission, sir," he said, "I was thinking about Bartleby. If he would prefer to take a quart of good ale every day, it would help mend him and enable him to examine his papers."

"So you have picked up the word too," I said, slightly agitated.

"What word, sir?" asked Turkey, crowding into the space behind the screen and jostling me against Bartleby.

"I would prefer to be left alone here," said Bartleby, as if offended.

"That is the word, Turkey," I said.

"Oh, prefer? Yes, that is a strange word. I never use it myself. But sir, as I was saying, if he would but prefer—"

"Turkey," I interrupted, "please withdraw."

"Certainly, sir, if you prefer."

As he left, Nippers asked from his desk whether I would prefer a certain paper copied on blue or white paper. He did not accent the word mockingly—it simply rolled from his tongue involuntarily. I thought to myself that I must get rid of this man who has already turned the tongues, if not the heads, of myself and my employees. But I thought it prudent not to dismiss him immediately.

The next day I noticed Bartleby did nothing but stand at his window staring at the wall. When I asked why he was not writing, he said he had decided to do no more writing.

"What? No more writing?"

"No more."

"What is the reason?"

"Do you not see the reason for yourself?" he replied indifferently.

I looked at him and saw that his eyes appeared dull and glazed. I realized that his intense copying by his dim window during his first weeks might have temporarily damaged his vision. I felt sympathy. I said something consoling and suggested he take some time away from writing and get exercise in the open air. However, he did not do this.

A few days later, when my other clerks were absent and I was hurrying to mail some letters, I thought Bartleby might be less inflexible than usual and carry the letters to the Post Office. But he blankly declined. So I went myself, much to my inconvenience.

Days went by. I could not tell whether Bartleby's eyes improved. When I asked, he gave no answer. He would do no copying. At last, he informed me that he had permanently given up copying.

"What?" I exclaimed. "Suppose your eyes get entirely well. Would you not copy then?"

"I have given up copying," he answered, and moved aside.

He remained a fixture in my office, becoming even more fixed than before. What was to be done? He would do nothing. Why should he stay? He had become a burden to me, not only useless but painful to bear. Yet I felt sorry for him. If he would name a single relative or friend, I would write immediately and urge them to take him away. But he seemed absolutely alone in the universe, like wreckage in the mid-Atlantic.

Finally, business necessities forced my hand. As decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days he must unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to find another place in the meantime. I offered to assist if he would take the first step. "And when you finally leave, Bartleby," I added, "I shall see that you do not go away entirely unprovided. Six days from this hour, remember."

When that period expired, I looked behind the screen. Bartleby was there.

I buttoned my coat, steadied myself, advanced slowly, touched his shoulder, and said, "The time has come. You must leave this place. I am sorry for you. Here is money. But you must go."

"I would prefer not," he replied, his back still toward me.

"You must."

He remained silent.

I had complete confidence in this man's honesty. He had frequently returned coins I had carelessly dropped on the floor. What I did next will not seem extraordinary.

"Bartleby," I said, "I owe you twelve dollars. Here are thirty-two. The extra twenty are yours. Will you take it?" I extended the bills toward him.

He made no motion.

"I will leave them here then," I said, placing them under a weight on the table. Taking my hat and cane and going to the door, I turned and added, "After you have removed your things, Bartleby, lock the door and slip your key under the mat so I may have it in the morning. I will not see you again, so goodbye. If I can be of service at your new place, advise me by letter. Goodbye, Bartleby, and fare well."

But he answered not a word. Like the last column of a ruined temple, he stood mute and solitary in the otherwise deserted room.

As I walked home, my vanity overtook my pity. I congratulated myself on my masterful management in getting rid of Bartleby. The beauty of my procedure was its perfect quietness. There was no vulgar bullying, no angry commands. I simply assumed he must depart and built all my statements on that assumption.

The next morning, however, I had doubts. Upon waking, I realized that my procedure was only theoretical. How would it work in practice? The great question was not whether I had assumed he would leave, but whether he would prefer to do so. He was a man of preferences, not assumptions.

After breakfast, I walked downtown, debating the probabilities. One moment I thought Bartleby would certainly be gone. The next moment I was sure I would find him at the office as usual. At the corner of Broadway and Canal Street, I saw an excited group of people.

"I will take odds he does not," said a voice as I passed.

"Doesn't go? Done!" I said instinctively, reaching for my pocket. Then I remembered it was election day. The words referred to some political candidate, not to Bartleby. In my anxious state of mind, I had imagined that all of Broadway shared my concern.

I arrived at my office earlier than usual. I stood listening. All was quiet. He must be gone. I tried the door. It was locked. Yes, my procedure had worked. He must have vanished. Yet I felt a certain melancholy mixed with my relief. I was almost sorry for my success.

I fumbled under the doormat for the key when my knee accidentally knocked against the door panel, making a sound. In response, a voice came from within: "Not yet. I am occupied."

It was Bartleby.

I stood thunderstruck. For a moment I was like a man struck by lightning, frozen in place.

"Not gone!" I murmured at last. But again obeying the strange power Bartleby had over me, I slowly went downstairs and out into the street. While walking around the block, I considered what to do. I could not physically throw him out. I could not call him names. Calling the police seemed unpleasant. Yet I could not permit him to triumph over me.

I decided to assume that Bartleby had already departed. Acting on this assumption, I might enter in a hurry and walk straight through him as if he were air. But this plan seemed dubious. I resolved to argue with him again.

"Bartleby," I said, entering the office with a quietly severe expression, "I am seriously displeased. I had thought better of you. I had imagined a slight hint would suffice. But it appears I am deceived. You have not even touched the money yet," I added, pointing to where I had left it.

He answered nothing.

"Will you or will you not leave?" I demanded in sudden anger, advancing close to him.

"I would prefer not to leave you," he replied, gently emphasizing the "not."

"What right have you to stay here? Do you pay rent? Do you pay taxes? Is this property yours?"

He answered nothing.

"Are you ready to work now? Are your eyes recovered? Could you copy a small paper this morning? Or help examine a few lines? Or step to the Post Office? Will you do anything at all to justify your refusal to leave?"

He silently retired behind his screen.

I was so nervous and resentful that I thought it prudent to restrain myself. Bartleby and I were alone. I remembered the tragedy of Adams and Colt, where Colt had killed Adams in a solitary office after becoming wildly excited during an argument. I thought that had the altercation occurred in a public place, it would not have ended in murder. It was the circumstance of being alone in a solitary office that enhanced the desperate irritation.

When resentment rose in me concerning Bartleby, I controlled it by recalling the divine commandment: "Love one another." This saved me. Aside from higher considerations, charity operates as a wise principle and a safeguard. Men have committed murder for jealousy, anger, hatred, and pride, but no man ever committed murder for charity's sake. Even mere self-interest should prompt people toward charity. On this occasion, I tried to view Bartleby's conduct charitably. Poor fellow, I thought. He means no harm. He has seen hard times and should be indulged.

I tried to comfort myself with the fancy that during the morning, Bartleby would emerge and leave of his own accord. But no. Half past twelve came. Turkey became obstreperous, Nippers grew quiet and courteous, Ginger Nut munched his apple, and Bartleby remained standing at his window. That afternoon I left the office without saying another word to him.

During the following days, I read books by Edwards and Priestley on philosophical necessity and predestination. These books induced a comforting feeling. I gradually convinced myself that these troubles with Bartleby had been predestined from eternity, and that Bartleby was assigned to me for some mysterious purpose I could not fathom. Yes, Bartleby, I thought, stay there behind your screen. I will not persecute you anymore. You are harmless and silent. My mission in this world is to furnish you with office space for as long as you choose to remain.

I believe this wise and blessed frame of mind would have continued if not for the remarks of my professional friends who visited my office. The constant criticism from narrow-minded people eventually wore down my generous resolve. People entering my office were struck by Bartleby's strange presence. Sometimes an attorney would try to get information from Bartleby about my whereabouts, but Bartleby would remain standing motionless, and the attorney would leave, bewildered.

When the office was full of lawyers and witnesses during proceedings, some legal gentleman would request Bartleby to fetch papers from another office. Bartleby would tranquilly decline and remain idle. The lawyer would stare in astonishment and turn to me for explanation.

Eventually, rumors circulated through my professional acquaintance about the strange creature I kept at my office. This worried me greatly. I imagined Bartleby living long, occupying my chambers, denying my authority, perplexing visitors, scandalizing my reputation, and casting gloom over the premises. He might outlive me and claim possession of my office by right of perpetual occupancy, supporting himself on his savings while spending only half a dime per day.

As these dark thoughts crowded my mind and my friends continued their relentless remarks, I resolved to rid myself of this burden.

I first suggested to Bartleby that he should permanently depart. In a calm and serious tone, I recommended the idea to his consideration. After three days of meditation, he informed me that he still preferred to remain with me.

What should I do? I thought. I must get rid of him. But how? I would not thrust this poor, pale, passive man out my door. That would be cruel. I could not do that. I would rather let him live and die here. But he will not budge. He leaves bribes under the paperweight. It is clear he prefers to stay.

Then what? Surely I will not have him arrested as a vagrant. On what grounds? He refuses to wander, so he cannot be called a vagrant. He does support himself, which is proof he possesses the means to do so.

Since he will not leave me, I must leave him. I will move my office elsewhere and give him notice that if I find him on my new premises, I will treat him as a trespasser.

The next day I told him, "I find these chambers too far from City Hall. The air is unhealthy. I propose to move my offices next week and will no longer require your services. I tell you now so you may seek another place."

He made no reply.

On the appointed day, I hired carts and men and removed everything. Throughout, Bartleby remained standing behind his screen, which I directed to be removed last. When it was folded up and taken away, he stood as the motionless occupant of a naked room. I watched him for a moment while something within me reproached me.

I reentered with my hand in my pocket and my heart in my mouth.

"Goodbye, Bartleby. I am going. Goodbye, and God bless you. Take this," I said, slipping something into his hand. But it dropped to the floor. Strange to say, I tore myself away from him whom I had so longed to be rid of.

Established in my new office, for a day or two I kept the door locked and started at every footfall in the passages. When I returned after any absence, I would pause and listen before applying my key. But these fears were needless. Bartleby never came near me.

I thought everything was settled when a troubled-looking stranger visited me, asking if I was the person who had recently occupied rooms on Wall Street.

Full of worry, I admitted I was.

"Then sir," said the stranger, who was a lawyer, "you are responsible for the man you left there. He refuses to copy, refuses to do anything, says he prefers not to, and refuses to leave the premises."

"I am very sorry," I said with assumed calm but inward trembling, "but that man is nothing to me. He is no relation or apprentice of mine."

"In mercy's name, who is he?"

"I cannot inform you. I know nothing about him. I formerly employed him as a copyist, but he has done nothing for me for some time."

"I will settle him then. Good morning."

Several days passed, and I heard nothing more. Though I often felt prompted to visit poor Bartleby, a certain reluctance held me back.

I thought it must all be over with him when, a week later, I found several people waiting at my door in a state of nervous excitement.

"That is the man—here he comes," cried the lawyer who had visited me before.

"You must take him away at once," cried a large man, the landlord of my old building on Wall Street. "These gentlemen, my tenants, cannot stand it any longer. Mr. B. turned him out of his room, and now he persists in haunting the building, sitting on the stair banisters by day and sleeping in the entry by night. Clients are leaving. Some fear a mob. You must do something immediately."

Shocked by this outburst, I stepped back. I protested that Bartleby was nothing to me, but they would not accept this. I was the last person known to have anything to do with him, and they held me accountable. Fearful of being exposed in the newspapers, I agreed that if the lawyer would arrange a private interview with Bartleby in his own room, I would try to resolve the nuisance that afternoon.

Going upstairs to my old office, I found Bartleby sitting quietly on the banister at the landing.

"What are you doing here, Bartleby?" I asked.

"Sitting on the banister," he replied mildly.

I motioned him into the lawyer's room, and the lawyer left us alone.

"Bartleby," I said, "are you aware that you are causing me great trouble by occupying the entry after being dismissed from the office?"

No answer.

"Now one of two things must happen. Either you must do something, or something must be done to you. What sort of business would you like? Would you like to copy for someone again?"

"No. I would prefer not to make any change."

"Would you like a clerkship in a dry-goods store?"

"There is too much confinement in that. No, I would not like a clerkship, but I am not particular."

"Too much confinement?" I cried. "You keep yourself confined all the time!"

"I would prefer not to take a clerkship," he said, as if to settle the matter.

"How would working as a bartender suit you? There is no eyestrain in that."

"I would not like it at all, though I am not particular."

His unusual talkativeness encouraged me. I continued.

"Well then, would you like to travel through the country collecting bills for merchants? That would improve your health."

"No, I would prefer to be doing something else."

"How about going to Europe as a companion to entertain some young gentleman with your conversation?"

"Not at all. That does not seem definite. I like to be stationary. But I am not particular."

"Stationary you shall be then," I cried, losing all patience and for the first time becoming truly angry. "If you do not leave these premises before night, I shall feel bound to quit the premises myself!" I concluded rather absurdly, not knowing what threat might frighten him into compliance.

Despairing of all efforts, I was leaving when a final thought occurred to me.

"Bartleby," I said in the kindest tone possible, "will you come home with me now—not to my office, but to my dwelling—and remain there until we can arrange something convenient for you at our leisure? Come, let us start now."

"No. At present I would prefer not to make any change at all."

I answered nothing. Dodging everyone by the suddenness of my flight, I rushed from the building, ran up Wall Street toward Broadway, and jumped into the first omnibus, soon removed from pursuit.

As soon as I calmed down, I realized I had done all I possibly could, both regarding the landlord's demands and my own duty to benefit Bartleby and shield him from persecution. I tried to be carefree and let my conscience rest, though I was not entirely successful.

I was so fearful of being hunted by the angry landlord and tenants that I surrendered my business to Nippers for a few days and drove around the upper part of town and through the suburbs. I crossed to Jersey City and Hoboken, and made visits to Manhattanville and Astoria. I practically lived in my carriage for that time.

When I finally returned to my office, I found a note from the landlord on my desk. I opened it with trembling hands. It informed me that he had sent for the police and had Bartleby removed to the Tombs as a vagrant. Moreover, since I knew more about him than anyone else, he wanted me to appear there and make a statement of the facts.

These tidings had a conflicting effect on me. At first I was indignant, but eventually I almost approved. The landlord's energetic action was a procedure I would not have chosen myself, but under the circumstances, it seemed the only option.

As I later learned, when told he must be taken to the Tombs, Bartleby offered no resistance but silently acquiesced.

Some compassionate and curious bystanders joined the group. Headed by a constable walking arm-in-arm with Bartleby, the silent procession made its way through the noise, heat, and activity of the busy streets at noon.

The same day I received the note, I went to the Tombs, or more properly, the Halls of Justice. I found the right officer and stated my purpose. I was informed that the individual I described was indeed there. I assured them that Bartleby was perfectly honest and deserving of compassion, however eccentric. I told them all I knew and suggested letting him remain in as lenient confinement as possible until something less harsh could be arranged. If nothing else could be decided, the almshouse should receive him. I then requested an interview.

Being under no disgraceful charge and quite harmless in his ways, they had permitted him to wander freely about the prison, especially in the enclosed grass yards. I found him there, standing alone in the quietest yard, his face toward a high wall. All around, from the narrow window slits, I saw the eyes of murderers and thieves peering out at him.

"Bartleby!"

"I know you," he said without looking around, "and I want nothing to say to you."

"It was not I who brought you here, Bartleby," I said, pained by his implied suspicion. "And this should not be such a terrible place for you. Nothing shameful attaches to you by being here. It is not as sad as you might think. Look, there is the sky, and here is the grass."

"I know where I am," he replied, but would say nothing more. So I left him.

As I entered the corridor again, a broad, heavy man in an apron stopped me.

"Is that your friend?" he asked, jerking his thumb over his shoulder.

"Yes."

"Does he want to starve? If he does, let him live on prison food. That is all."

"Who are you?" I asked.

"I am the grub-man. Gentlemen who have friends here hire me to provide them with good food."

"Is this true?" I asked the guard.

He confirmed it.

"Well then," I said, slipping some coins into the grub-man's hand, "I want you to give particular attention to my friend there. Let him have the best dinner you can provide. And be as polite to him as possible."

"Introduce me, will you?" said the grub-man eagerly.

Thinking it would benefit Bartleby, I agreed. After learning the grub-man's name, I went with him to Bartleby.

"Bartleby, this is Mr. Cutlets. You will find him very useful."

"Your servant, sir, your servant," said the grub-man, bowing behind his apron. "Hope you find it pleasant here, sir. Spacious grounds, cool apartments. Hope you will stay with us some time. We will try to make it agreeable. May Mrs. Cutlets and I have the pleasure of your company for dinner, sir, in Mrs. Cutlets's private room?"

"I prefer not to dine today," said Bartleby, turning away. "It would disagree with me. I am unused to dinners." He slowly moved to the other side of the enclosure and faced the dead wall.

"How strange," said the grub-man, addressing me with astonishment. "He is odd, is he not?"

"I think he is a little disturbed," I said sadly.

"Disturbed? Well now, I thought that friend of yours was a gentleman forger. They are always pale and refined, those forgers. I cannot help pitying them. Did you know Monroe Edwards?" he added sadly, laying his hand on my shoulder. "He died of consumption at Sing-Sing. You were not acquainted with Monroe?"

"No, I was never socially acquainted with any forgers. But I cannot stay longer. Look after my friend. You will not regret it. I will see you again."

A few days later, I again obtained admission to the Tombs and went through the corridors searching for Bartleby, but I did not find him.

"I saw him coming from his cell not long ago," said a guard. "Maybe he has gone to loiter in the yards."

I went in that direction.

"Are you looking for the silent man?" said another guard passing me. "He lies sleeping in the yard there. It has not been twenty minutes since I saw him lie down."

The yard was completely quiet. It was not accessible to the common prisoners. The surrounding walls, of amazing thickness, kept out all sounds. The Egyptian character of the masonry pressed upon me with its gloom. But soft grass grew underfoot. It was like the heart of eternal pyramids, where by some strange magic, grass seed dropped by birds had sprouted through the cracks.

Strangely positioned at the base of the wall, his knees drawn up, lying on his side with his head touching the cold stones, I saw the wasted form of Bartleby. But nothing stirred. I paused, then went close to him and stooped over. I saw that his dim eyes were open, but otherwise he seemed profoundly asleep. Something prompted me to touch him. I felt his hand, and a tingling shiver ran up my arm and down my spine to my feet.

The round face of the grub-man appeared.

"His dinner is ready. Will he not dine today either? Or does he live without dining?"

"Lives without dining," I said, and closed his eyes.

"What? He is asleep, is he not?"

"With kings and counselors," I murmured.

There is little need to proceed further in this story. The reader can imagine poor Bartleby's burial. But before parting, let me say that if this narrative has interested you enough to wonder who Bartleby was and what kind of life he led before I met him, I share that curiosity but am wholly unable to satisfy it.

Yet I should mention one small rumor that came to me a few months after Bartleby's death. I could never determine its basis or verify its truth. But since this vague report held a certain strange interest for me, it may prove the same for others, so I will briefly mention it.

The report was this: Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead Letter Office in Washington, from which he had been suddenly removed by a change in administration.

When I think about this rumor, I cannot adequately express the emotions that seize me. Dead letters—does it not sound like dead men? Imagine a man prone by nature and misfortune to pallid hopelessness. Can any job seem more fitted to increase it than continually handling dead letters and sorting them for the flames? They are burned by the cartload annually.

Sometimes from the folded paper, the pale clerk takes a ring—the finger it was meant for perhaps molders in the grave. A banknote sent in swift charity—the person it would have relieved no longer hungers. Pardons for those who died despairing. Hope for those who died without hope. Good news for those who died amid unrelieved disasters. On errands of life, these letters speed to death.

Ah, Bartleby! Ah, humanity!
